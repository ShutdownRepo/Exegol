# :memo: Things to start
  Here are some things to do that I have in mind, I'll work on that asap. You can help if you feel like it!
  - check if some docker calls can be done with with docker-py
  - enable connections through SOCKS4a/5 or HTTP proxies so that all of Exegol can be used through that proxy, simulating a advanced internal offensive system (callable with a `--proxy` or `--socks` option)
  - find a way to log commands and outputs for engagements: inspiration from https://github.com/TH3xACE/SCREEN_KILLER ?
  - Check if the following freshly installed tools work nicely: bettercap, hostapd-wpe, iproute2
  - Tools to install: arjun, apksign, cfr, dex2jar, drozer, jre8-openjdk, jtool, p7zip, ripgrep, smali, zipalign, frida, adb, dns2tcp, revsocks, chisel, ssf, darkarmor,amber, tikitorch
  - install tools for mobile applications pentest
  - exegol.py : check the docker service is running
  - exegol.py : check the running user is in the docker group, if not, ask the run with privileges (sudo)
  - install https://github.com/seajaysec/cypheroth/
  - install https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8814au
